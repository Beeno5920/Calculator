# Calculator
This is a simple calculator app I made by using javafx.
This is the first project I worked to get more familiar with java GUI.

User can use the calculator by clicking the buttons, the input will be displayed on the top-left corner and the result will be 
displayed on the bottom-right corner.

### improvement 
I will later on add more functions, such as sin, factorial and power, to the calculator and allow user using keyboard to type.
